This project includes a lexer, a parser, and a compiler that converts Erika into LLVM IR. Advanced understanding of data structures, and compiler design was needed to start this project. This project is still in progress.",

    description: "I believe in the power of Linux and preach its good word to everyone I meet. Of course, the good thing about Linux is its customizability, so from the very beginning, I set out to create a unique experience of computing. Desktop environments require too many resources; I use a bare-bone server distro with a lightweight tiling window manager: i3. To get daily utility, I have had to write countless config files, and critical and reliable scripts. These include a script for a dynamic background, a brightness controller, low battery reminder, and a 20-20-20 rule reminder. Other scripts that solve daily problems include a punch in program to time the productive hours spent behind the machine and a useful apple photo converter that converts unviewable apple photo formats and live photos to jpeg.

To connect to the hosting server, I used command line tools such as FTP and SFTP on a regular basis. ",

It was built using Python and works with a text user interface. Users can create profiles or change their criterion within the interface to find the perfect movie. The code was written in modular format to allow for future addition of a graphical user interface. ",
